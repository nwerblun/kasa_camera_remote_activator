# kasa_camera_remote_activator
Checks if my phone's IP is present in the network. If my phone leaves (I have left the house) then it activates all cameras. If I am home, they are turned off for privacy.

Call main.py with 2 args. Arg 1 = kasa account (tplink) user email. Arg 2 = your password

This app is really bad, has like 0 security and is a super quick script I will probably run on a rasperrby pi or something. Use at your own risk.
